## Customizing the Web Page

If you wish to use a different web page:
1. Open the script.
2. Scroll to the `setup_content` function.
3. Replace the HTML inside the `cat > /var/www/html/index.html` section with your own HTML content.

Alternatively, you can manually replace the file:
```bash
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
```
Paste your custom HTML and save.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu/Debian system
- Internet connection (to install packages)
- `figlet` (optional, for fancy title banner)

The script will auto-install all dependencies if missing.
